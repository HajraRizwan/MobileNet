  - ## Introduction
    # Content: |
      [MobileNet](https://arxiv.org/abs/1704.04861) is a deep learning architecture designed for mobile and resource-constrained devices. It enables real-time machine learning applications such as image recognition and object detection directly on mobile platforms.

  - ## Features
    # Content:
      - "Lightweight Architecture: Optimized for devices with limited computational resources."
      - "Efficient Operations: Uses depthwise separable convolutions to reduce computational costs."
      - "Real-Time Performance: Supports fast predictions for mobile devices."
      - "Scalable Design: Adjustable with width and resolution multipliers to fit specific requirements."

  - ## Setup and Installation
    # Subsections:
      - # Clone the Repository
        # Content: |
          ```bash
          git clone https://github.com/your-username/mobilenet-project.git
          ```

      - # Install Dependencies
        # Content: |
          ```bash
          pip install tensorflow numpy pillow
          ```

      - # Test Setup
        # Content: |
          Run the example code provided in the [Usage](#usage) section to validate your installation.

  - ## How It Works
    # Content: |
      MobileNet replaces standard convolutions with **depthwise separable convolutions**, breaking them into:
      1. **Depthwise Convolution**: Applies a filter per input channel (e.g., R, G, B channels).
      2. **Pointwise Convolution**: Combines outputs using 1x1 convolutions.

      This approach reduces computational requirements while maintaining high accuracy. For more details, read the [MobileNet Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1704.04861).

  - ## Real-World Applications
    # Subsections:
      - # Image Recognition
        # Content: |
          Used in applications like plant identification apps. For example, it identifies a plant by comparing an input image against a database of known plants.

      - # Face Detection
        # Content: |
          Deployed in smart locks for secure facial authentication.

      - # Object Detection
        # Content: |
          Real-time object detection in augmented reality (AR) and gaming platforms.

  - ## Usage
    # Subsections:
      - # Example for Image Classification
        # Content: |
          ```python
          from tensorflow.keras.applications import MobileNet
          from tensorflow.keras.applications.mobilenet import preprocess_input, decode_predictions
          import numpy as np
          from PIL import Image

          # Load Pretrained Model
          model = MobileNet(weights='imagenet')

          # Load and Preprocess Image
          img = Image.open('path_to_image.jpg').resize((224, 224))
          img_array = preprocess_input(np.expand_dims(np.array(img), axis=0))

          # Predict
          predictions = model.predict(img_array)
          print(decode_predictions(predictions, top=1))
          ```
