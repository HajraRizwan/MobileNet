  - heading: "How It Works"
    content: |
      MobileNet replaces standard convolutions with **depthwise separable convolutions**, breaking them into:
      1. **Depthwise Convolution**: Applies a filter per input channel (e.g., R, G, B channels).
      2. **Pointwise Convolution**: Combines outputs using 1x1 convolutions.

      This approach reduces computational requirements while maintaining high accuracy. For more details, read the [MobileNet Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1704.04861).

    subsections:
      - subheading: "Image Recognition"
        content: |
          Used in applications like plant identification apps. For example, it identifies a plant by comparing an input image against a database of known plants.

          import numpy as np
          from PIL import Image

          # Load Pretrained Model
          model = MobileNet(weights='imagenet')

          # Load and Preprocess Image
          img = Image.open('path_to_image.jpg').resize((224, 224))
          img_array = preprocess_input(np.expand_dims(np.array(img), axis=0))

          # Predict
          predictions = model.predict(img_array)
          print(decode_predictions(predictions, top=1))
